# Designing for Atomic Design
I wrote my bachelor's thesis on how designers could better design for atomic design. Although my portfolio is only published in German (for now), the thesis was written and published in Englishâ€”just scroll a bit and click the "Bachelor-Arbeit (PDF)" button. [Visit the project page on wenzels.design!](https://wenzels.design/projects/designing-for-atomic-design)

This repository is a placeholder. I mentioned it in the thesis as the place where I might ocntinue to publish more material on the topic.
